Algorithm design technique

1) Brute force

2) Divide and conquer

	- binary search

	- quick sort

	- merge sort

3) Greedy

	- prims algorithm

	- krushkal algorithm


4) Dynamic programming
	
	- Fibonacci series

   	- Knapsack

   	- Longest common subsequence
	
	- Matrix chain multiplication

	- Traveling salesman problem


5) Backtracking

	- N queen problem
